**Air Canvas:**


Welcome to Air Canvas, where the childhood dream of drawing in the air becomes a reality. Since waving fingers in the air and drawing without pens or ink has long captivated our imagination, we've developed Air Canvas using machine learning and advanced technologies such as Computer Vision and MediaPipe. This groundbreaking platform empowers users to effortlessly sketch with their fingers, offering a vibrant array of colors on a virtual canvas. Through the utilization of MediaPipe, an open-source framework, our system employs machine learning pipelines to detect hand landmarks in real-time video, enabling functionalities like hand detection, landmark showcasing, distance recognition between landmarks, and canvas printing. Air Canvas is easily accessible on any system, requiring only a camera, making it a highly accessible and user-friendly tool for unleashing creativity. Beyond revolutionizing computer vision applications, Air Canvas enhances computer-human interaction, opening up a world of possibilities in virtual art, education, and entertainment. Join us in redefining the boundaries of creativity and expression!
